If your documents folder is a mess with a bunch of files and need organizing. Run this file as a batch extention and it will create folders in alphabetical order then move each file to each individual folder. Its mostly two lines of code. 
Just rename the .txt extention to .bat to run the code. 
Rename the text document to _File Organizer.bat
